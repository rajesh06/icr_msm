The most basic states of a claim are "open" and "closed". For purposes of our case study we further refined our model to include the following 4 states:
  
  Open Zero (oz): open with no value
  Open Non-Zero (onz): open with incurred value
  Closed Zero (cz): closed with no value
  Closed Non-Zero (cnz): closed with value
  
This refinement allows us to answer the "how" by observing if the claim closes with or without value.

Our case study is a rather simplistic approach to defining states. There are countless ways to define states, for example, we could introduce a threshold such as 500 thousand of incurred value. We would then have three open states; open zero, open with incurred value less than 500 thousand, and open with incurred value greater than or equal to 500 thousand. Other examples include incorporating paid to incurred ratios or "type" of claim (i.e. observation, claim or suit). As we refine states the model complexity will increase. For practical purposes outside of this case study the defining of states will depend on the ultimate goal of the model and the indicators available in the data.
