Section 2 will focus on state transitions for individual claims. Our model will track individual claim movements by age using Markov Transition Matrices. The model will answer the following two quesitons; when will the claim close and how will the claim close (i.e. close zero or close with value). We will use two R packages related to Markov matrices, "markovchain" and "msm" and an additional package which allows data manipulation "dplyr" which can be downloaded as follows:

```{r install and load pacakges}
install.packages("markovchain")
install.package("msm")
install.package("dplyr")

library("markovchain")
library("msm")
library("dplyr")
```

This Section will be outlind in 5 steps; defining states, organizing data, visualizing a transition matrix, selecting transition probabilities, and simulation results. The ultimate outcome of this Section is to produce a probability distribution as to how claims close.
